# The Morning Warm Up
 
A collection of warm up exercise implementations.

## Introduction

I think it is stupid that we start our work days cold when we all know how
important it is to warm up before exercising. This is me doing that with some
simple problems that should take at most half an hour to solve or implement. It
doesn't really matter if problems get resolved, as long as they different
languages or approaches get explored.

ranging from the absurdly easy (Hello World) to much harder.
